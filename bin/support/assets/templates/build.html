<h1>Build</h1>
<p>
  If you are developing a javascript only web application, then you do not 
  need to build until you want to deploy on a production server. The build step
  will then optimize your javascript files and assets and provide you a much
  smaller app more suitable for deployment. 
</p>
<p>
  Building is performed using <a href="http://gruntjs.com">grunt</a>. Your
  <em>skeleton</em> application provides already a suitable Gruntfile.js that you
  can just run by typing <em>grunt</em>. 
</p>
<p>
  The built application is placed in <em>/build</em>, and when the application
  is started in production mode it will serve it from there:
  <pre>
    npm start --production
  </pre>
</p>
<p>
  (Note, this only works as long as you do not manually specify a MODE
  environment, if so just start using: <em>node server.js</em>).
</p>
<p>
  This minimal application example should help you with your first applications,
  you can find more information at the website.
