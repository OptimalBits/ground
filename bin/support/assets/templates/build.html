<h1>Build</h1>
<p>
  If you are developing a javascript only web application, then you do not need to build until you want to deploy on a production server. The build step will then optimize your javascript files and assets and provide you a much smaller app more suitable for deployment.

<p>
  If you develop a typescript application you will need to build everytime you perform changes in your typescript code.
