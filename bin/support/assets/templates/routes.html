<h1>Specify your routes</h1>
<p>
  In any Ground you will need to define routes to access the diferent parts of
  your application. The routes are hierarchical, so you can define the content 
  of every subroute without re-rendering the rest of the webpage that stays
  the same.
  
  Check in this example app, as the routes are defined for the navigation bar.
  <pre>
  <code>
    // If this is the last component we render a default template
    if(req.isLast()){
      req.render('assets/templates/welcome.html');
    }

    // As an example, this route is handled via an external file
    req.get('configure', '#main', 'routes/configure');

    req.get('models', '#main', function(){
      req.render('assets/templates/models.html');
    });

    req.get('routes', '#main', function(){
      req.render('assets/templates/routes.html');
    });

    req.get('views', '#main', function(){
      req.render('assets/templates/views.html');
    });

    req.get('build', '#main', function(){
      req.render('assets/templates/build.html');
    });
  </code>
  </pre>
</p>
<p>
  Routes can be implemented all in the same file or if the handlers are large you
  modularize them specifying them in separate routes in <em>app/routes/<em>.
  It is important that the route files are places under the correct directory so
  that the build system can work as expected.
</p>
<p>
  Generally a route will require a template to be rendered when the user access
  the given route. You can by default use standard html or underscore 
  <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#template">microtemplates</a>. You can of 
  course use any other template engine you want.
