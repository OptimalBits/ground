<h1>Define your models</h1>
<p>
  Models are defined using schemas using a very similar syntax to the one used
  in <a href="http://mongoosejs.com">Mongoose</a>, a popular <a href="http://mongodb.org">MongoDB</a> ORM.
</p>
<p>The best practice for models is to put every model in its own .js/.ts file and in models.js aggregate all models in one object for easy export to clients and servers. Place them under: <pre>myapp/app/models</pre>
</p>
<p>
Both clients and server will have access to the model classes, so you only need to define them in one place.</p>

<p>
  Check for example in app/models/animal.js:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
  define(['gnd'], function(Gnd){

    var AnimalSchema = new Gnd.Schema({
      name: {type: String},
      desc: {type: String},
      legs: {type: Number, max: 4, min: 2}
    });

    return Gnd.Model.extend('animals', AnimalSchema);
  })
</code>
</pre>
