<h1>Create your Views</h1>
<p>
  The simplest kind of view that you can create in Ground are based on html 
  (plain or templated) and binded to models, collections or sequences via a
   <a href=http://gnd.io/ViewModel>ViewModel</a>. This is an important piece
   in the MVVC programming model.
</p>
<p>
  Although views based on html and ViewModel are very powerful, it is sometimes
  necessary to create more advanced views and for that you can subclass the
  View class. You can read more about views <a href="http://gnd.io/#views">here</a>.
